#Week 1 Project - Tic Tac Toe

**Objective:** Refactor your Tic Tac Toe app to Use Object Oriented Programming

This week we have been learning about writing constructors, and working with prototypes.

Today we will be making a Tic Tac Toe game using all of this.

## Minimum Requirements
* We must have a TicTacToe constructor and a Player Constructor
* When the TicTacToe constructor is instantiated it should create two instances of player: one for X and one for O
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
* Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`.
* Upon marking of an individual cell, use javascript to add a class to each cell to display separate colors.
* A cell should not be able able to replayed once marked.
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
