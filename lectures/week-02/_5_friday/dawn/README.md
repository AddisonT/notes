# Friday Review

Today, we'll be doing a review of material covered over the course of the week. But before that, we're going to talk a bit about `git`.

## Git

Git notes:
  * [Git Overview](git.md)
  * [Git Commands and Details](git_details.md)


## Review Time

Before you head off for a quick break after our `git` discussion, please take a few minutes to send me the topics you'd like to review on Slack. You can do it in strictly business or via private message to me or any of the other insructors.
